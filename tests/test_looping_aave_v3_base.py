    """
    Test demonstrating a leveraged DeFi strategy using flash loans and Aave V3.

    This test implements a "looping" strategy where:
    1. Flash loan WStETH (10x the vault's balance)
    2. Supply all WStETH (original + flash loaned) as collateral to Aave V3
    3. Borrow WETH against this collateral (90% LTV)
    4. Swap borrowed WETH back to WStETH via Aerodrome DEX
    5. Repay the flash loan with the swapped WStETH

    The result is a leveraged position where the vault has increased WStETH exposure
    while maintaining a borrowing position on Aave V3. This amplifies both potential
    gains and risks from WStETH price movements.
